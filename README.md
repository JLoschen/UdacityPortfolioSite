# Udacity-Arcade Game Project
This is a project I did for the Udacity [Front End Web developer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The project is meant to get the student used to the basics of html and css as well as using flexbox for responsive design.
